# Custom server & client recreation of Agar.io

- Built for performance (despite JS)
- Don't look at server/arena.js I was 14 when I wrote that and as performant as it may be it's nightmarish to maintain

Check out `config.default.yaml` or `server/cells` for an idea of what's possible with this implementation!
